            <h1 class="card-title">MendLine</h1>
            <p> To streamline the process of seeking specific services for clients and professionals, MendLine's online questionnaire system lets users input medical history and symptoms and analyzes for common signs of illnesses, either recommending ways for clients to self-treat or referring them to specific professionals within the system, reducing the time spent assigning. CONSUMERS: The post-appointment consumer dashboard will contain information on protocols for diagnoses, future surgeries, and treatment plans to improve adherence. In addition, the quizzing system allows doctors to monitor long-term trends in response to certain treatment plans and a quick way for clients to alert them in case of an unexpected yet not emergency-level reaction, connecting them far after the appointment has ended for better personalized care. In addition, it streamlines the billing process. 
PROFESSIONALS: MendLine organizes consumer information in a way that can be accessed by a set circle of professionals, balancing both flexibility and confidentiality. Professionals can search up individuals and receive concise pages demonstrating their recent appointments, reported symptoms, suggested treatments, and current reactions to it.
