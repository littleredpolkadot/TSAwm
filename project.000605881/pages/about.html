            <p>
           During the COVID-19 crisis, we watched our communities and businesses shut down to preserve the lives of thousands. Our hospitals became filled with patients, and we lacked the capacity to reserve physical space for many of our clients. The telehealth services we used lacked high-quality customer service, clean interfaces, and did not meet our criteria for the safety of medical data online. In response, we created MEND with the top cybersecurity and medical firms to address the existing gaps in service we saw, developing an artificial intelligence based system to take into account a client's medical history and needs to give advice or referrals. 

We see telehealth as extending far beyond our nation's current situation. Telehealth is a way to address the overburden of health professionals and the inconvenience of the current system at once.
